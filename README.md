# Alien_invasion_with_play_button
This is my first project after completing the basics of python, this is similar to the game called "SPACE INVADER" in which I have added a play button and score stats too.
Upon starting this project I got some minor problems with my code but as I continue to update my code with various classes and functions for this game, things started to sort out and seems to clear.
You can easily understand what each and every line of code is actually doing as I have added enough comment to make my code easy to read
I have used sublime text editor and during whole process I kept using sublime to build the project in python.
Enjoy!! the game.
Thanks.
